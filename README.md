# TWO_ CENTURIES_OF_UM_RACES
## Overview

This project analyzes two centuries of UM races, focusing on athlete performance trends across different events, countries, and age categories. Using Python and data science techniques, it explores historical trends, gender representation, country-wise performance, and club dominance. The project also provides recommendations based on insights drawn from the data.

## Dataset

The dataset includes:

Year of Event – When the race took place.

Event Name – Type of race or competition.

Athlete Performance – Metrics like time, speed, rank, or score.

Athlete Country – Country representation of athletes.

Athlete Gender – Male or female participation trends.

Athlete Club – Clubs associated with athletes.

Athlete Age Category – Classification based on age groups.

Additional Attributes – Other relevant performance indicators.


## Project Objectives

Analyze historical trends in race performances over two centuries.

Compare athlete performances across countries, clubs, and age categories.

Identify trends in gender participation and performance gaps.

Provide data-driven recommendations for future competitions and athlete training.


## Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data processing and manipulation.

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization.

Scikit-learn – Potential for machine learning-based insights.

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis.


## Key Insights & Findings

Performance Trends: Improvements in race times and performance standards over time.

Country-Wise Dominance: Certain nations consistently outperform others.

Gender Participation: Shifts in male and female participation rates.

Age Category Trends: Influence of age on race performance.

Club Performance: Clubs with the most top-ranking athletes.


## Recommendations

Talent Development: Countries and clubs should focus on nurturing young talent.

Training Optimization: Use historical data to refine training programs.

Inclusivity Strategies: Encourage gender balance in participation.

Predictive Analysis: Apply machine learning to forecast future race outcomes.
